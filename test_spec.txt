Objective: To validate the generateSoundex function with multiple test cases that cover a variety of scenarios, including names with different consonants, vowels, special characters, and apostrophes, ensuring the function returns the correct 4-character Soundex code.
 
// Testcase 1: Common Name Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleCommonName
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a common name with standard consonants.
Purpose: Ensure that a common name is correctly converted into its Soundex representation, including the appropriate translation of consonants into digits.
  Input:           Expected Output:
"Robert"              "R163"
 
// Testcase 2: Name with Different Consonants Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleNameWithDifferentConsonants
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name with different consonants across its letters.
Purpose: Ensure that a name with a variety of consonants (non-repeated) is correctly converted, confirming that each consonant is mapped to its corresponding Soundex digit.
  Input:           Expected Output:
"Ashcraft"             "A261"
 
// Testcase 3: Single Character Name Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleSingleCharacterName
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a single-character name.
Purpose: Ensure that a single character is handled properly by assigning it the correct initial letter and filling the rest with zeros.
  Input:           Expected Output:
   "A"                 "A000"
// Testcase 4: Name Starting with a Vowel Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleNameStartingWithVowel
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name that starts with a vowel.
Purpose: Ensure that names starting with a vowel are processed correctly, and that consonants following the vowel are converted as per the Soundex rules.
  Input:           Expected Output:
"Euler"               "E460"
 
// Testcase 5: Short Name with No Changes Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleShortNameWithNoChanges
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a short name that should not change much due to its simplicity.
Purpose: Ensure that short names that donâ€™t contain complex consonant patterns are correctly filled with zeros after the first letter.
  Input:           Expected Output:
  "Lee"                "L000"
 
// Testcase 6: Name with Special Character '@' in Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleNameWithSpecialCharacter
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name containing a special character.
Purpose: Ensure that special characters such as @ are ignored and do not affect the conversion process of the name.
  Input:           Expected Output:
"B@rton"                "B635"
 
 
// Testcase 7: Name with Repeating Letters Soundex Conversion
Testcase name : HandleNameWithRepeatingLetters
Test Scenario: Verifies the Soundex conversion of a name with repeating letters.
Purpose: Ensure that repeated letters are compressed into a single occurrence in the Soundex conversion.
  Input:           Expected Output:
"Addams"               "A352"
